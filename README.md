# Countries Database 
This project uses the [REST Countries](https://restcountries.com/) API to create a database of all the countries around the world. The database is linked to a GUI front-end that allows users to select how they want to view the data of the countries. The users can also choose if they want to view the countries worldwide or by any of the 7 continents. For example, the user can choose to compare the top five countries by population in Europe, or any nine countries in worldwide by area. Or the user can choose four specific countries in south America to view general information about them. 

General information for each country includes:
- Common name, e.g., Suriname
- Official name, e.g.,  Republic of Suriname
- Capital
- Area in square kilometers
- Population
- Currency
- Continent, etc. 

## Skills
- Web access, API call, JSON 
- Database CRUD using SQLite
- Display data with matplotlib 
- GUI front end with Tkinter

## Program Files
- `final_back.py` has the API call and the code to create the database from the resulting JSON download. Running this file creates two additional files:
  - `area_pop_data.csv`, a CSV of the numeric (integer) data from the database
  - `countries.db`, a sqlite database of the countries data from the API
- `final_front.py` has the GUI front end to navigate and display the data using TKinter.

## Installing and Running the Program
The program requires that python already be installed on your local machine. If you do not have python installed, you can download the latest version from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/). 

To run this program, download [`final_back.py`](https://github.com/morosebose/countries_data/blob/main/final_back.py) and [`final_front.py`](https://github.com/morosebose/countries_data/blob/main/final_front.py) from this repository into a single folder/directory on your local machine. After doing so, use the command line to run each file in this order: first `python final_back.py`, then `python final_front.py`. 

You have to run `final_back.py` the first time. On subsequent occasions, you can simply run `final_front.py`. As long as you have not moved or deleted any of the files created by `final_back.py`, the program will run as normal. However, it is recommended that you run `final_back.py` from time to time to ensure that you have the most updated information from the API.
