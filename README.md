Final project for CIS 41 B
James Kang, Surajit Bose

## Description
This project uses the [REST Countries](https://restcountries.com/) API to create a database of countries. Information for each country includes:
- Common name, e.g., Suriname
- Official name, e.g.,  Republic of Suriname
- Capital
- Population
- Currency
- Continent, etc. 
The database is linked to a GUI front end that allows the user to choose up to five countries either by continent or worldwide and display the data. For example, the user can choose to display the top five countries by population or by area. The user can also choose specific countries to see all the information about them. 

## Skills
- API call, JSON 
- SQLite
- numpy or pandas
- matplotlib 
- Tkinter

## New skills for purpose of lab
- Many-to-many relationships among database tables, e.g., Turkey and Russia straddle continents
- Writing out database table to CSV file
- Box plots for matplotlib, e.g., show the population distribution of all the countries by continent using box plots
